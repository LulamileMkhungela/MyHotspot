                <h6 class="sec-title"><b>Overview</b></h6>
                <p class="desc">Venuefy is an on-demand service for booking venues for events in multiple cities throughout Pakistan. Initially developed for tentative
                    booking; however, there wasn’t much buy-in from the customers as one can make a tentative booking over a phone. Therefore, a new
                    strategy was formulated to renew the objectives and vision for the product. It was decided that the application would enable the user
                    to book venues for wedding/marriage events as well as for other events like seminars, and meetings.</p>
                    <pclass="des"><b>Problem: </b>
                        Booking venues for a Desi wedding/marriage is a little lengthy and complex than booking a room in a hotel because wedding events
                        involve decor, reception food, photographers, musicians, and sometimes wedding cars as well. Therefore, an application was needed
                        that could easily provide all the aforementioned services to the user</p>
                <p class="des"><b>Goals: </b>Design an application that would enable the user to easily book venues with all the necessary arrangements required for events as
                    well as hire other services like photographers, musicians, and transport services (wedding cars) if needed. Pay for the services via
                    credit card or Google Pay and receive notifications as arrangements are made.</p>

                <p class="des">As there isn’t any UX design process set in stone and also the fact that one doesn’t always have the luxury of time and resources to
                    abide by each and every step of each and every process. Therefore, I had to make do with resources available. Below is the process

                <h2 class="head1">Surveys</h2>
                <p class="des">I conducted a small survey in order to gather information about users and their requirements which would further aid in creation of
                    personas, user stories and other artifacts. The survey provided sufficient data which was mostly quantitative as I didn’t have time or
                    resources to interview some potential users. Based on the information gathered via the survey, it was concluded that most potential
                    users will use the application especially for booking a venue in & from a different city. Since there is no direct competitor in the current
                    local market, I had to resort to studying indirect competitors in the international market. I studied applications about booking hotel
                    rooms, renting houses/apartments, reservations at restaurants etc. in order to get insights about the entire booking process, best UX
                    practices, and design trends. The applications studied were Airbnb and Booking.com respectively.</p>

                    users of the application and to make sure I don’t digress from the main goal. I received multiple overlapping answers from the survey
                    conducted, therefore, I created the following two personas:</p>

                <p class="des">After a brainstorming session between the stakeholders and myself, we created multiple user stories in order to create a mental
                    model to make sure that the product is user-centered, goal-focused, and also to determine what feature is implemented at which
                    stage and what should be implemented afterwards. We started off with Epics and then further broke them down to granular levels to
                    make the stories more clearer and goal-specific.</p>

                <p class="des">The finalized sketches of the application were converted into medium fidelity wireframes as per the requirements using Figma. The
                    reason why the wireframes were created in medium fidelity was because it would be easier for users to comprehend them based on
                    my previous experiences where during the testing of the low fidelity wireframes, the users were confused regarding the colors and
                    other elements on the screen.</p>

                    <p class="des">Since I was the only one in the design department therefore, I had to assume the mantle of a UI designer as well and thus after
                        making a few minor changes in the wireframes and having created a mood board, I started creating high fidelity mockups. Based on
                        the feedback received about the first design draft, changes were made in the entire application to in order to introduce a few extra
                        features and also to enable the users to fully book and pay for the venue via the application. Below is the final high fidelity design:</p>

                    on-demand applications due to the secondary and primary researches.</p>
