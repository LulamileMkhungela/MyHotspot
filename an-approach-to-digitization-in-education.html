      <p>I-Learn is an online platform that enables students to interactively and playfully create solutions to real-world challenges through Design Thinking and based on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bmz.de/de/ministerium/ziele/2030_agenda/17_ziele/index.html">17 Sustainable Development Goals</a>.<br></p>
      <p>Through this concept of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge-based_learning">challenge-based learning</a>, a closer integration of society and school as well as a stronger awareness of the student‘s responsibility and ability to act is achieved.<br></p>
      <p>It should be noted that this project was accompanied by a three-month <a href="https://careerbasedchallenge.com" target="_blank">user experience design training</a>, followed by a fixed course plan and a digital implementation was planned. It helped me to deepen my knowledge in user experience design and to explore approaches to <a href="https://www.jotform.com/educational-technology/" target="_blank">digitization of school lessons</a> and to find out how impulses for modern learning can be set in accordance with the sustainability goals.</p>
      <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
      <p>So far, there were no comparable offers, so my research applied to products from the field of e-learning, preferably with a focus on challenge-based learning and the target group children &amp; adolescents.<br></p>
      <p>The creation of competitive profiles (in terms of marketing strategy, target market, core business, usability, layout, navigation structure, compatibility, content, design and performance) together with SWOT analysis helped to assess current offers in this area.<br></p>
      <p>Also, general advantages and disadvantages of online courses and the question of how e-learning could be integrated into the context of conventional school forms was an important part of the research.</p>

        <h1><strong>Opportunities and Challenges of E-Learning</strong></h1>
        <h3>Opportunities</h3>

          <div class="tagline insight-tagline">Opportunity #1</div>
          <h3 class="insight-heading">Individual learning types<br></h3>
          <p class="insight-paragraph">Through self-learning systems, the learning process can be individually adapted for each student. Studies have shown, for example, that students who were considered weak in the classroom, after a short time with adaptive, tailor-made curricula many were even better than the previous best in class. These students simply needed more time for the basics, which then led to better and faster understanding of the more complex follow-up topics.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <div class="tagline insight-tagline">Opportunity #2</div>
          <h3 class="insight-heading">Timeliness &amp; availability<br></h3>
          <p class="insight-paragraph">Outdated or incorrect information can be updated at any time. Textbooks would therefore be obsolete and materials could no longer be forgotten or lost at home. Insofar as there is sufficient Internet access, global availability is possible.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <div class="tagline insight-tagline">Opportunity #3</div>
          <h3 class="insight-heading">Self-organized learning<br></h3>
          <p class="insight-paragraph">Through the on-demand availability, self-organization regarding time, place and topic becomes possible. The pure transfer of knowledge (know-how) takes place digitally, which gives the teacher more time to offer individual advice and orientation (Know Why). The knowledge broker role of the teacher shifts into the background in favor of the role as the student‘s companion and guide.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <div class="tagline insight-tagline">Opportunity #4</div>
          <h3 class="insight-heading">Interactivity and multimedia<br></h3>
          <p class="insight-paragraph">Possibilities of interactivity and multimedia, through playful exploration of context, higher engagement, direct feedback and more empathy (for example about technologies such as Virtual Reality or the possibility to communicate easily with affected persons).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <div class="tagline insight-tagline">Opportunity #5</div>
          <h3 class="insight-heading">Lower costs<br></h3>
          <p class="insight-paragraph">There is no cost to buy textbooks, which will also make it easier for financially weak families to access education. In addition, e-learning contributes to the saving of financial, human and time resources, i.a. by simplifying various processes for schools, teachers and students.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <div class="tagline insight-tagline">Opportunity #6</div>
          <h3 class="insight-heading">Automated learning success control<br></h3>
          <p class="insight-paragraph">Students receive immediate feedback and can work with teachers and parents to follow their learning process. There is a risk of over-control and thus less self-organized learning, but also the chance to measure one&#x27;s own learning progress less with other students and instead with one&#x27;s own progress.</p>

          <h3 class="insight-heading">Lack of acceptance<br></h3>
          <p class="insight-paragraph">Low acceptance of the teaching staff (and some parents), since a change of teaching methodologies and, in general, often also a change in attitudes, including e.g. a higher level of trust is required.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">

          <h3 class="insight-heading">Isolated Learning<br></h3>
          <p class="insight-paragraph">The high availability and flexibility results in less exchange with other learners and thus a weaker sense of community, which can lead to a loss of motivation in the long term.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <div class="tagline insight-tagline">Challenge #4</div>

      <div class="rich-kid w-richtext">
        <h3>Generally</h3>
        <p>Learning in the form of traditional teaching and e-learning both require self-discipline, motivation and acceptance of the methodology, whereby e-learning – insofar as it is used in isolation – relies more on intrinsic motivation.</p>

      <h2>Interviews &amp; Surveys</h2>
      <p>With the knowledge of Design Thinking, E-Learning and the image of sustainable education according to ESD and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG‘s) I conducted interviews with pupils and teachers from the grades five to thirteen.</p>
      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <ul role="list">
        <li>Which group constellation is preferred for the project work and why?</li>
        <li>What is the willingness to become active within the meaning of the SDGs?</li>
        <li>What support is desired from students and teachers?</li>
        <li>To what extent are digital tools already being used for learning?</li>
        <li>What about digitization at the respective school? What are the obstacles in school life?<br></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Based on the responses received, I formulated questions for an online survey that was answered by 202 people (about 75% teachers, 25% students) within one day – of course this survey is not representative, especially if you still have the differences between younger and more experienced teachers and between the different age groups of students.</p>

          <p class="insight-paragraph">Group work is not liked, but this is mainly due to lack of motivation of individuals within the groups and different types of learning. Because individual performance is still often valued, it is all about fighters - slower learners stay behind while faster learners feel abandoned.</p>

          <p class="insight-paragraph">Even lower-level students can handle apps of a high degree of complexity, while educators often take much longer. One consequence is that teachers are judged by the students not to be competent. In an attempt to regain authority, teachers tend to use unfavorable methods, thus the teacher-student relationship suffers. Is the positioning of teachers as knowledge facilitators still relevant?</p>

          <p class="insight-paragraph">Teachers would like to use more technology for educational purposes, but their school infrastructure is inadequate and there is a lack of easy-to-learn and helpful software. There are also regular room changes, unreliable technology and Internet connectivity, too few devices, hardly any maintenance of the technology, incompatibilities between programs and devices (e.g., smartboard not powerpoint enabled), and high setup times (e.g., slow build / install).</p>

      <h2>Building empathy</h2>
      <p>Using the quantitative and qualitative data from interviews and survey results, I defined the three target group profiles Peter (Teacher, 55), Sarah (Student, 16) and Tobias (Student, 13) to better empathize with my main user groups and prioritize goals according to their needs.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Digitization could revolutionize the entire education sector. Not for the sake of digitization, but because, as also highlighted in the research, thereby an important and profound social change is possible: The change from the teacher to the learning companion; as Gunther Dueck would say, “from the right to the true man”; from the rigid transfer of knowledge to the human companion through a time in need of orientation. In general, I see here the great opportunity of digitization, namely that it gives people the opportunity to become “more human” – a more empathetic, collaborative and social learning and working culture.<br></p>
      <p>I completed the course in three instead of the normally planned nine months and chose my own project. Due to the complexity of the project that I chose and the demanding course plan, I was able to implement hardly any major adjustments to the concept in the short time. Also, the training provided a digital solution, where I can imagine as the first prototype also analogous materials to increase the acceptance and feasibility in schools.<br></p>
      <p>Rather, it requires a change in attitudes and investment in a reliable technical infrastructure before the full potential of digital platforms such as I-Learn can be harnessed. Of course, this is an interplay and requires digital solutions that are worth upgrading or questioning attitudes.<br></p>
      <p>With the ambition to create a solution that can be adopted by schools, integrates sustainable development goals into school life and brings society and schools closer together, I was doomed to fail – the goal was far too vague and big. Also, I approached the project with too many strong ideas, which in retrospect was not conducive to reasonably responding to the research findings. My result is therefore rather an approximation and, above all, at the conceptual level requires further work, e.g. to facilitate a smarter group work.</p>
      <p>It is also to be learned whether I-Learn would prescribe a too strict course of Design Thinking, because Design Thinking is more of a mindset rather than a very concrete process (in terms of methods used). For this, it would need more experience from the field.<br></p>
      <h3>If there was more time available…</h3>
      <ul role="list">
        <li>Development of further user personas and Journey Maps / Task Models – in addition to the product-based Journey Map an experience-based Journey Map</li>
        <li>More research, as it‘s a complex and extensive topic with many factors (for example, technical and social challenges) and various stakeholders</li>
        <li>Further iterations / test phases, actually test the course plan in a real classroom<br></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Learnings</h2>
      <p><strong>#1 Big challenges require small steps</strong> <br>Take small steps, because big changes can not be brought overnight, especially not just by an application alone. Accordingly, develop more strategically meaningful and realistically applicable tools that steer in the intended direction.<br></p>
      <p><strong>#2 Be open to research and let ideas go <br>‍</strong>I thought too digitally and approached the product with too concrete ideas about the result, thus failing to correctly take into account some needs and challenges of the target group and thus unfavorably defined the minimum viable product.<br></p>
      <p><strong>#3 Journey Maps are my new best friend <br>‍</strong>Especially as it gets more complex, Journey mapping is very helpful, on the one hand to put a comprehensive process on paper and to uncover problematic and promising points, on the other hand to provide a basis for good cooperation for all stakeholders.<br></p>
      <p><strong>#4 Distribute polls via Facebook pages <br>‍</strong>More participation than expected, surprisingly many insights won and many answers to open questions received. Facebook pages with the appropriate fellowship and activity can quickly reach a relevant target group.<strong>‍</strong></p>
      <p><strong>#5 Interview questions chosen unfavorably <br>‍</strong>Looking back, I would rebuild the interviews differently as I used too many questions where interviewees should imagine what the optimal solution might be (for example, “describe your dream school”). Especially through the book “<a target="_blank" href="http://momtest.com">The Mom Test</a>” I have been able to uncover many of my mistakes. It would have needed further interviews with teachers and school management (as well as parents) to create a more complete picture.<br></p>
      <p><strong>#6 More substantive visual design <br>‍</strong>In the meantime, inasmuch as no visual language has yet been defined, I would define brand attributes in advance, which can be used to orient oneself with regard to the visual appearance as well as (linguistic) formulations – see my project for youth culture work.<br></p>
      <h3>There are already good analogue materials, which I would like to recommend at this point.</h3>
      <p>For example, &quot;<a target="_blank" href="https://buildyourfuture.com/">Build your future</a>&quot; provides very good materials to do design thinking projects in schools. It should be emphasized here that not only students, but primarily the teachers are very well taken by the hand and thus the inhibition threshold is lower to carry out such projects.<br></p>
      <p>For an entertaining insight into the topic of Design Thinking, e.g. suitable for single lessons, <a target="_blank" href="http://molly.is/writing/design-dash/">Molly&#x27;s Design Dash</a> is great, especially if you replace the predefined topics with real school challenges and the opportunity to work on the projects beyond school time.<br></p>
      <p>Rather with high school students in mind, there would be the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.modelsofimpact.co/">Models of Impact</a> Game, where based on societal challenges, social entrepreneurial business models are developed.<br></p>
      <p>Also worth mentioning is IDEO&#x27;s <a target="_blank" href="https://designthinkingforeducators.com/">Design Thinking for Educators</a> Toolkit, which has started a big movement here.<br></p>
