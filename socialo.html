Half of the interviewees were students who usually volunteer in social projects. There were 10 project managers from 10 different NGOs that run several social projects in a year and also 5 brands which sponsor these projects from the CSR budget.

                                The goal was to get a better understanding of their fears and pain points and their desired solution. Our interview questionnaire had 15 questions in 3 different sections:</p>

                                            <p class="des3" style="padding-top: 10px;">I usually start the design process with low-fidelity sketches to visualize the basic concept really quickly. I share these sketches with the product managers to find out misunderstanding points or different ideas. This is the way I iterate through many design options quickly. </br>

                                                I did the same for this messaging system and in the end, I came up with <b>2 different designs</b>  for conversation inbox. In design A, had tile designs for each conversation and had 2 conversation cards in a row. It's kind of a new design. I like this design as it's unique and beautiful.  In contrast, design B was a widescreen design that shows a single conversation in a row.</br>
                                                
                                                I wanted to <b>check the user feedback and reactions</b>  after I presented an interactive prototype.  As I learned from researches, that categorizing the conversation is super important, I tried to create different sorting options in the inbox for users to be able to prioritize displaying new conversations.

                                            <p class="des3" style="padding-top: 10px;">At this stage, I started my work with wireframes and mostly about structure and visual hierarchy. How my product <b>looks</b> . Normally after concentrating on the look I will work on  <b>interaction experience</b>  to check <b>both look and feel.</b> 


                                                I used to work with <b>Zeplin.com</b> for creating wireframes and then export it to <b>Invision</b>  to produce interactive prototypes.
                                                
                                                Nowadays, I only use <b>Adobe XD</b>  to create both wireframes and interactive prototypes, faster and easier.</p>
                                        </div>
                    
                                        <div class="col-md-7">
                                            <img class="fullw" src="assets/img/designs/error.png">

                                    </div>

                                    <div class="row">

                                        <div class="col-md-7 col-md-offset-1">

                                            <p class="des3" style="padding-top: 10px;">At this stage, we wanted to make sure how users are interacting with the design. So we started checking how they use the product and see how they grasp the concept. Our testing session was a kind of moderated testing.

                                                Finally realized it was confusing for some of the users to find the header of the conversation inbox. I came up with some ideas for redesigning the header. In this iteration, I pull out new message and settings icons from the header. Added settings icon in the top row next to the screen title. The new conversation icon, converted to a button. I made two versions of buttons, one with an icon and the other one with text to see the user's reactions in A/B tests. In this version, we only have search and sort in the top header bar which made the design simple and clean!</p>

                                    <p>We had an A/B testing session. For the conversation layouts.

                                        Found out user's preferences were Design B (Widescreen design) rather than Design A (Tile design). Although some users said design B is beautiful but some of the users totally got confused. According to their feedback, they expected to see a widescreen conversation inbox instead of seeing each conversation as a card in a tile view.
                                        
                                        Also checked two versions of New Conversation buttons in mobile design with users and realized users see the rectangular icon+text button easier than a circular icon-only button.
                                        
                                        </p>

                                <p>By doing user and usability tests during the UX Design we could iron out issues early on. BEFORE wasting time and money developing a product that needs to be fixed again and again!


                                    We had 7 participants to attend at a focus group and share their feelings and feedback about the design and the experience with us. I realized we need more iterations and changes in the design to make it friendlier and also useful.
                                    
                                    We also asked everybody to answer these 5 questions:
                                    
                                    </p>

                    <p>I learned I shouldn't emphasize details at the beginning of the ideation phase too much. I should get usability test results and work on details in the iterations to learn more what I am doing is right or not. </p>
