            <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2" id="overview">
      <p class="des">
        I am Lulamile in I live in Turffontein,As far as my educational qualification is concerned I have Grade12 along with UX/UI Design at JCSE and other software development online certifications to stay relevant in the industry. </br>
        I have 4years experience as a UX/UI Designer and had worked for different organisations such as mLab,TheDigital Academy,GirlCode,OpenSesyme and Hypothetical Objective Systems as a UX/UI Designer,Developer when necessary.Am grateful to start-ups companies I had worked for which gave me an opportunity to understand the ins-and-outs of the industry, and to take on tasks which I don't have knowledge about but to take the tasks and work my best to get it done </br>
         - My prior experience in UX/UI Design provided me with technical skills and an extensive knowledge  on emphasizing before research starts, product process flow,interacting with end users/clients. </br>
         As a UX/UI Designer I use this knowledge to ensure i am meeting customers needs with every step that requires the user and following my design process which includes Discover,Define,Ideate,Design,Test and Deliver,In my process I will be using tools like Miro,OptimalWorkshop,Lucidchart,Framer,Balsamiq,AdobeXd,and still learning figma,Invision </br>
         I really enjoy learning new things,doing research, as much My end goal is to become UX researcher I am practising to be it by writing articles which are found on my portfolio and I am part of Design community whereby I will be publishing my articles there. </br>
        
        Lastly :
        I am a very good communicator and It's easy for me to relate to other people </br>
        Self-motivated person with cheer drive for success with that being said "I'm not a failure and not afraid of failure in case if it happens I fail, For example …I didnt pass grade12 well but that didnt let me to sit down and allow the financial situation to determine what i want to be as am always positive attitude towards my career & life "
    </br>

        Weaknesses;
        1. I cant say no when someone asks for help,I get bored when given a task that doesnt challenge me,impatient on people that dont do what is expected of them.
        2.Metrics and data analytics
    </br>
        Strengh:
        1.problem solver,team player(helping people either at work and outside work,hard-working person with positive attitude towards my career & life
        2.Communication - spreading knowledge and ideas are my daily tasks within my team
        2.Prototyping,interaction design
        
        

</p>

<p class="des">
        How are you going to use your skills to make an impact in the organisation?

      </br>  
        1.Initiate new ideas
I Take time to be proactive and originate new concepts. While thinking out-of-the-box may be out of my comfort zone, I will generate more possibilities, learn a lot and inspire others.
</br>
2.Update coworkers on your progress
A good colleague supports his or her coworkers. Let your team members know the status of projects you are working on and invite them to share their opinions. When everyone has had the opportunity to contribute, it leads to a better overall outcome.
</br>
3.Be positive
Sometimes it can be challenging but those who have a great attitude—consistently—attract the attention of others. Being positive helps reduce stress, increases productivity as well as interpersonal relations with others. Im not afraid to show my passion!
</br>
4.Let others count on me
I Always deliver high-quality work and make sure others know they can trust me to get the job done. By demonstrating competence, it will leave a lasting impression.
</br>
5.Pay attention to what your coworkers say
Me being a great listener, it shows that Im truly interested in what is being said.
</br>
6.Speak up
I Share what i believe/think its right. It’s an important form of honesty. Others might not always agree but speaking up shows confidence and can fuel discussion, group-thinking and new ideas.
</br>
7.Go the extra mile
I Take initiative to accomplish tasks without being asked. I dont do take for the sake of coworkers and supervisors to notice me but to give them a reason why they would not let me go in case i want to go. By doing more than what is expected or required
</br>
7.Be a leader
I once Lead a team whereby leadership helped me grow confidence in my team and improved productivity
</br>
8.Network
Connect with others inside and outside of your office. You never know if someone you meet will be able to assist in you in future.
</br>
9.Think ahead
I Stay step ahead and get into the habit of always looking for solutions. Voicing my thoughts is an important component to my job growth and development.forward-thinking i consider it as an asset.

<p><strong>Conclusion<br>‍</strong>In retrospect, I feel this exercise wasn‘t exactly what the client expected (probably an issue with my positioning) because I aimed towards thinking about the whole ecosystem instead of just the website itself (and probably failed on communicating it sufficiently in the beginning). </p>
<p>Usually, I do this exercise also in terms of revenue, but since the organization is well-funded, we‘ve left it out to save time. To expose potentially hidden treasures, I think it would have been good to do it anyway.<br></p>
<p>Also, I realized that the rating by numbers is kinda abstract. For the future I‘d prefer the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHI-vCSX0Uo">effort impact mapping</a> exercise, since it is way more tangible by evaluating the ideas by needed effort and expected impact, categorizing them into “Do now” (low effort, high impact), “Make it a project” (high effort, high impact), “Make it a task” (low effort, low impact) and “Skip” (high effort, low impact).</p>
