                <p class="des" style="padding-top: 10px;">User-centered design is a framework that places the user at the center of the design and development process. It focuses on who'll be using a product, the tasks they need to complete while using the project, and the environment in which they'll use the product. 
            </br>
           <b>Discovery:</b> The goal of this phase is to identify those who’ll be using my product, the conditions they’ll use it under, any business requirements, and finally, the user needs of my product. To put it simply, this is where I  determine what it is I am building. This phase typically consists of competitive analyses, audience definition, user scenarios, and surveys.
        </br>
        <b>Concepting:</b> This phase is all about creating design solutions that address the business and user requirements. I’ll be crafting wireframes, user flows, mockups, and finalized interface designs
    </br>
    <b>Prototyping and User Testing:</b>  During this phase, I determine if the design solution is effective via user testing.

                    To do this I had to develop a set of overarching rules and standards that can help to maintain consistency across multiple platforms and devices. </br>
                    
                    The Design Language system I created included rules for the following elements: </p>

                                    I understood the importance of specifying the context of the use of the application, who will use it, under what conditions they will use it, and to be able to define business requirements and user goals that need to be met for the success of the product. I realize how it can be useful to learn what works and what doesn't works from the competitors. </br>
                                    
                                    I also particularly enjoyed performing user interviews and usability testing, where I was surprised to discover how each user can react so differently when trying to solve their problems. This reinforced the concept of how helping the users to reach their goal easily always needs to be the main focus of my design. </p>
