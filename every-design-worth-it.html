        <h2>1. Start your research from the inside </h2>
        <p>I was scheduling a usability test when a friend from the Support Team just came over and said: <br><br> “Did you see the latest report about user doubts? 
        <p>“Yes. I did.” – I said. “So why are you trying to get insights when they’re popping out at us everyday?” Bam! She was right. </p>
        <p>I double checked the report and it was clear where I should focus on my research:</p>
        <p>The point is: I was trying to plan a test from zero when there were lacks already known in the products that I could use as a starting point for my research. It would save me a lot of time if I had checked this out before! It doesn’t mean as a designer I shouldn’t take the time and interact with my customers by myself… but you have to keep in mind that there are people in other teams who already do that. Everyday.So go to talk to them, schedule a 15min weekly meeting and let them share what’s coming up regularly from users. Gather the data. And then start planning your research.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="rich-text-block w-richtext">
    <h2>2. Block a time in your design routine</h2>
    <p>Most of the people are just passing by, late for their appointments or just want to grab a snack and leave, so it’s important to keep in mind how you come to them and ask for their help. I used to follow this script:
    </p>
</div>
<div class="rich-text-block w-richtext">
    <h2>3. Go where your customers are</h2>
    <p>You don’t need to arrange a perfect scenario to collect insights from your users. Just create a list with the places where you can easily find them and get there. <br><br> I used to go to some café or to my university, find a calm spot so I could leave my computer and ask for people passing by if I could show them a project I was working on… and guess what! They were like “Sure! Why not?”. <br><br> The good point about doing a test in a crowded place is that it replicates the usage scenario for most of the product, especially if you’re testing an app. People don’t pay full attention to your interface and probable do many tasks while using your application. So it’s a good opportunity to see whether the key visuals, call to actions and your writing has the correct impact.</p>

    <h2>4. Prepare your pitch and get used to the NO’s</h2>
    <p>Most of the people are just passing by, late for their appointments or just want to grab a snack and leave, so it’s important to keep in mind how you come to them and ask for their help. I used to follow this script:</p>
    <blockquote class="block-quote">“Hey, I’m Le_Loux! We are about to launch a new project… but before we’d love to hear your thoughts about that. Would you mind to come over and give me your feedback? It’ll take only two minutes.”</blockquote>
    <p>It worked. Especially because:</p>
    <div>
    <b>“We’d love to hear your thoughts”:</b>  People like to be heard and feel they are contributing to something.</br>
    <b>“Travel Startup”:</b> Startup is a trendy word and people like to know and get up to date about.<br> 
       <b>“We’re about to launch”:</b> Create a sense of urgency like we are just waiting for you to make it real. </br>
       <b>Only two minutes</b> Come on, two minutes…. <br></br>
       <p>You’ll still receive a lot of No’s, of course, and it’s normal. But when that happens just move to the next and try again.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rich-text-block w-richtext">
        <h2>5. Break the test so you can run them quickly</h2>
        <p>As you are in a public place and people don’t have plenty of time to spend with you, I suggest to split your test in different tasks.</br> For example, if you want to get insight about people are not buying your product or dropping out of the purchase flow you could split the flow in different tasks:</p>
    </div>
      <div>
    <b>“We’d love to hear your thoughts”:</b>  People like to be heard and feel they are contributing to something.</br>
    <b>“Travel Startup”:</b> Startup is a trendy word and people like to know and get up to date about.<br> 
       <b>“We’re about to launch”:</b> Create a sense of urgency like we are just waiting for you to make it real. </br>
       <b>Only two minutes</b> Come on, two minutes…. <br></br>
       <p>You’ll still receive a lot of No’s, of course, and it’s normal. But when that happens just move to the next and try again.</p>
       
       <b>Landing Page: </b>  Showing users the first page for a fee seconds and ask what they saw and understood about the page.</br>
       <b>Search & Payment:</b> Ask users to find a specific product and see how easy they complete the task.  You could use a few people for the test 1 and 2 and it won’t require much time for both.<br> 
    </div>
    
    <div class="rich-text-block w-richtext">
        <h2>Summing Up</h2>
        <p> User Experience goes beyond UI. It goes through a deep understanding of the customers needs, pains and behaviour. Any projects I came across, came to help me discover this assets through research, validation and data analysis; in order to guide me in decision making, priorisarion and helping me create better products </br>So Firstly, gather feedback from your own team, protect a time in your calendar so you add it to your weekly routine, find where your users are and go there, prepare and improve your pitch and split your test in different tasks. Hope it helps you as it helped me 🙂</p>
