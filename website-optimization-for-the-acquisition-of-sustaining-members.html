                            <p class="des"><b>Results: </b> <br>
                                <ul>
                                <li><b>Leo Miguel</b> – 25–36 years old He take their work holidays to travel through a different city or country to meet new people, explore new places specially to practice their English (or other language their are interested about) and learn new skills.<p></li>
                                    <li><b>Nolly Nollz</b>– 18–24 years old They take his University summer holidays to travel having a different travel experience while saving money. It’s not only a tourist experience but something that will improve their CV, carreer and knowledge.</li>

                                    <li><b>John Vuligate</b> - 22–35 years old They want to quit his longterm-job to travel for undetermined time. Looking for a new “routine”, self-knowledge and a drastic change in their life. They want to start traveling or had already started their journey.</li>
                                </ul></p>
                                <p class="des"><b>First touch: </b> 
                                    Onboarding: An understanding about what Wirler is all about.
                                    Wirler invests so much in acquiring new users, we definitely didn’t want to lose them after their very first visit. Besides that, it was important to create a personal experience onboarding those users and lead them to a brand connection & personalised content throughout the app usage.<br></p>
                                    <p class="des"><b>Possible solutions to gain understanding and build trust would be: </b> <br>
                                    <li>To help me understand how the app users navigate and what factors influence the users decision, I've arranged face-to-face meetings and Skype calls. I gave them assignments and asked them to think aloud about the idea.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>That’s why we introduced an onboarding asking specific questions to build a path to relevant results, explaining what was the app for and create a way to let travers say their travel plans at a glance. To define the onboarding questions, we interviewed the stakeholders and conducted interviews asking travelers to priositise the most important factors in deciding to book a trip with Wirler.</li>
                                    <li><b>Search :</b> Once travelers got the full understanding of what Wirler is all about, they need to find a the right position to apply and start their journeys.</li>
                                    <li><b>Hosts :</b>  Finding a perfect host means to find a place where you could match your purpose on the trip with the need of the supply side. To make it clear at a glance, we devided the host listing explanation in two parts. What you offer: with big icons explaining the main tasks and requirements. What to get: highlighting rewards and benefits by applying to that position. The host listing was also decided in other factors that contribute to the users choices such as availability, requirements, photos and reviews.</li>
                                    <h2 class="head1">About the project</h2>
                                    <p>To get a rough overview of the process, it helped to build a very simple journey map. This was especially useful to communicate it in the team and to have everyone on the same page.
                                        To help travelers decide the last things before travel and solve doubts about the trip, we introduced a community to connect traveleds and Wirler.</p>

                <p class="head2" style="padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;">How can we improve travelers experience?
                </p>
                <p>To comply with my non-disclosure agreement, I have omitted confidential information in this case study. All information is my own and does not necessarily reflect the views of Wirler. Wirler is a community based on collaboration that makes travel more accessible to those seeking a profound cultural experience. Through an online platform, we connect travelers – looking to exchange their skills for accommodation – with incredible hosts from all around the world. In 2019, we decided to develop a mobile application; and launch it in all mobile platforms.The app is to help travelers to find and confirm their Wirler experience on the go. I was part of the project of building the Wirler app to give users a better experience whether chilling in a chair at home or heading to work in a crowded train. Our high level goals were:</p>
                <ul class="head2">
                    <li>Increase user retention.</li>
                    <li>Faster the response time. </li>
                    <li>Create an engaging platform.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row full">
        <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
            <div class="sharing-area text-center">
                <h6 class="sec-title"><b>Improvements for the next iteration</b></h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>Automatic validation</li>
                    <li>
                        Since my technical expertise is limited, in the given time I wasn‘t able to technically pull off a multistep-form that handles the validation of fields after each step correctly. So in order to avoid false data, dead ends and thus user drop-off I decided to declare the quite long form as good-enough to go live and to adjust accordingly in the next iteration.</li>
                        <li>Presentation of the benefits of using Wirler                        </li>    
                </ul>
                <h6 class="sec-title"><b>Conclusion</b></h6>
                <p>
                    So often seemingly obvious but absolutely forgotten things emerge out of interviews and quick user tests. The task of “quickly integrating the possibility to become a member” became something bigger and we investigated the complete app and understood how the users use the app plus what factors play a role to finally decide on how to complete users travel. So, the mere function is without value if you don‘t consider the whole journey </p>
