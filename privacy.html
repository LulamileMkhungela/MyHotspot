This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of the website, and other statistics.</p>
</h3>
 <p><strong> Security</strong></p>
    <p> I value your trust in providing me your Personal Information, thus I'm striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.
 </p>
    <p><strong>Who is the responsible party for the recording of data on this website (i.e. the “controller”)?</strong></p>    
    <p>This data comprises primarily technical information (e.g. web browser, operating system or time the site was accessed). This information is recorded automatically when you access this website.</p>
    <p><strong>What are the purposes I use your data for?</strong></p>
    <p>A portion of the information is generated to guarantee the error free provision of the website. Other data may be used to analyze my user patterns.</p>
    <p><strong>What rights do you have as far as your information is concerned?</strong></p>
    <p>You have the right to receive information about the source, recipients and purposes of your archived personal data at any time without having to pay a fee for such disclosures. You also have the right to demand that your data are rectified or eradicated. If you have consented to data processing, you have the option to revoke this consent at any time, which shall affect all future data processing. Moreover, you have the right to demand that the processing of your data be restricted under certain circumstances. Furthermore, you have the right to log a complaint with the competent supervising agency.</p>
    <h2>2. Hosting and Content Delivery Networks (CDN)</h2>
    <h3>External Hosting</h3>
    <p>This website is hosted by an external service provider. Personal data collected on this website are stored on the servers of the host. These may include, but are not limited to, IP addresses, contact requests, metadata and communications, contract information, contact information, names, web page access, and other data generated through a web site.</p>
    <h2>3. General information and mandatory information</h2>
    <h3>Data protection</h3>
    <p>The operators of this website and its pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. Hence, I handle your personal data as confidential information and in compliance with the statutory data protection regulations and this Data Protection Declaration.</p>
    <p>Whenever you use this website, a variety of personal information will be collected. Personal data comprises data that can be used to personally identify you. This Data Protection Declaration explains which data I collect as well as the purposes I use this data for. It also explains how, and for which purpose the information is collected.</p>
    <p>I herewith advise you that the transmission of data via the Internet (i.e. through e-mail communications) may be prone to security gaps. It is not possible to completely protect data against third party access.</p>
  <h3>Right to object to the collection of data in special cases; right to object to direct advertising</h3>
    <p>IN THE EVENT THAT DATA ARE PROCESSED, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AT ANY TIME OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA BASED ON GROUNDS ARISING FROM YOUR UNIQUE SITUATION. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO ANY PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. TO DETERMINE THE LEGAL BASIS, ON WHICH ANY PROCESSING OF DATA IS BASED, PLEASE CONSULT THIS DATA PROTECTION DECLARATION. IF YOU LOG AN OBJECTION, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA, UNLESS WE ARE IN A POSITION TO PRESENT COMPELLING PROTECTION WORTHY GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING OF YOUR DATA, THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR IF THE PURPOSE OF THE PROCESSING IS THE CLAIMING, EXERCISING OR DEFENCE OF LEGAL ENTITLEMENTS.</p>
    <p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS BEING PROCESSED IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN DIRECT ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AT ANY TIME OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSES OF SUCH ADVERTISING.</p>
    <h3>SSL and/or TLS encryption</h3>
    <p>For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as purchase orders or enquiries you submit to me as the website operator, this website uses either an SSL or a TLS encryption program. You can recognize an encrypted connection by checking whether the address line of the browser switches from “http://” to “https://” and also by the appearance of the lock icon in the browser line.</p>
    <h3>Information about, rectification and eradication of data</h3>
    <p>Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the right to at any time demand information about your archived personal data, their source and recipients as well as the purpose of the processing of your data. You may also have a right to have your data rectified or eradicated. If you have questions about this subject matter or any other questions about personal data, please do not hesitate to contact me at any time at the address provided in section “Information Required by Law.”</p>
    
    <h3>Server log files</h3>
    <p>The provider of this website and its pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files, which your browser communicates to me automatically. The information comprises:</p>
    <ul role="list">
      <li>The type and version of browser used</li>
      <li>The used operating system</li>
      <li>Referrer URL</li>
      <li>The hostname of the accessing computer</li>
      <li>The IP address</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is not merged with other data sources.</p>
    <p>This data is recorded on the basis of Art. 6. The operator of the website has a legitimate interest in the technically error free depiction and the optimization of the operator’s website. In order to achieve this, server log files must be recorded.</p>
    <h3>Request by e-mail, telephone or fax</h3>
    <p>If you contact me by e-mail, or phone call, your request, including all resulting personal data (name, request) will be stored and processed by me for the purpose of processing your request. I do not pass these data on without your consent.</p>
    <p>The data sent by you to me via contact requests remain with me until you request me to delete, revoke your consent to the storage or the purpose for the data storage lapses (e.g. after completion of your request). Mandatory statutory provisions - in particular statutory retention periods - remain unaffected.</p>
