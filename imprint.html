 <p>By using or using the website, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the website. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the website, any part of the website. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the website, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the website into other languages, or make derivative versions. The website itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Lulamile Mkhungela.
<p>
I'm committed to ensuring that the website is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, I reserve the right to make changes to the website or to charge for certain services, at any time and for any reason. I will never charge you for the website or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
</p>
<p>
The website stores and processes personal data that you have provided to me, in order to provide my Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone/computer and access to the website secure. I therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone/computer, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s/computer's security features and it could mean that the website won’t work properly or at all.
</p>
<p>
You should be aware that there are certain things that I will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the website will require the website to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but I cannot take responsibility for the website not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
</p>
<p>
If you’re using the website outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the website, or other third party charges. In using the website, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the website outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the website, please be aware that I assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the website.
</p>
<p>
Along the same lines, I cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the website i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, I cannot accept responsibility with respect to responsibility for your use of the website, when you’re using the website, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, I do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that I can make it available to you. I accept no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the website.
</p>
<p>
At some point, I may wish you to refresh the website so you can get updates on it. The website is currently accessed on any devices – the requirements for system (and for any additional systems I decide to extend the availability of the website to) may change. Upon termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the website, and (if needed) delete the website history from your device.
</p>
 <p><strong> Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong></p>

I may update my Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.

</p>
   
     <p><strong>  Liability for Links</strong></p>
    <p>My offer includes links to external third party websites. I have no influence on the contents of those websites, therefore I cannot guarantee for those contents. Providers or administrators of linked websites are always responsible for their own contents.</p>
    <p>The linked websites had been checked for possible violations of law at the time of the establishment of the link. Illegal contents were not detected at the time of the linking. A permanent monitoring of the contents of linked websites cannot be imposed without reasonable indications that there has been a violation of law. Illegal links will be removed immediately at the time I get knowledge of them.</p>

    <p><strong>  Copyright</strong></p>
    <p>Contents and compilations published on these websites by the providers are subject to copyright laws. Reproduction, editing, distribution as well as the use of any kind outside the scope of the copyright law require a written permission of the author or originator. Downloads and copies of these websites are permitted for private use only.<br>The commercial use of my contents without permission of the originator is prohibited.</p>
    <p><b><u>Copyright</u></b> laws of third parties are respected as long as the contents on these websites do not originate from the provider. Contributions of third parties on this site are indicated as such. However, if you notice any violations of copyright law, please inform me. Such contents will be removed immediately.</p>
