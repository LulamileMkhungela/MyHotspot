                 <h5 class="sec-title">Let’s start: what is the role of a designer?</h5>
                     <p> Have you ever thought that in all objects, furniture, cars, houses, smartphones, apartments, in any structure made by humankind, there was someone who designed it? In other words, a person who decided that an object was going to be like that and not like that? Scratchy and not smooth? Light and not heavy? Gray and not red?

                        This person was a designer. </br>
                        
                        That’s why the design position is not just another position in the product development pipeline. It’s a position responsible to guide those around him/her whether designing a simple form, projecting a stool, or conceiving long term product vision.  </br>
                        
                        As designers, we also push teams to think forward . We grab, as a dog grabs a bone, the user interests and pains.  </br>
                        
                        We seek to solve the whole problem, not only looking to aesthetics, but also to what strikes the origin of the pain.  </br>
                        
                        “Design is also the process we undertake to solve a problem. It fucking hurts to catch a baseball with your bare hand. A mitt is the solution to that problem.” Mike Monteiro, 2015, Medium article “Why you need design” 
                        
                        It’s also our responsibility to look beyond functionality, hierarchy, consistency, usability, aesthetics and accessibility. We want not only the solution that works well, but the one that works for everyone.   </br>
                        
                        “Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like. People think it’s this veneer - that the designers are handed this box and told, ‘Make it look good!’ That’s not what we think design is. It’s not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.” Steve Jobs, 2003 New York Times article “The Guts of a New Machine.”   </br>
                        
                        Quite a responsibility, right? That’s why hiring a designer suck.</div></p>

          <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2" id="overview">
    <h5 class="sec-title">Hiring a designer is absolutely hard </h5>
    <ul role="list">
        <li>Anyone who has ever hired designers knows how difficult it is. Who are them? Where they live? How to define if it is a good hiring? It’s almost a treasure hunt to find a good fit in the cover letters and portfolios.</li>
        <li>And it’s not only because of the portfolios, but also because of the lack of standardization to evaluate the candidate and the few documentation of good hiring practices in the market. </li>
        <li>This means that, at the end of the day, each company uses its own methodology and it’s not clear the criteria for who recruits, much less for those who apply.</li>
        <li>How to do it: Roles and Schedule ? </li>
            </ul>
             <h5 class="sec-title"> Deciding what the team needs?</h5>
            <p>A good exercise is to explain the role and expectations of the job in just a few lines. 
                
                “A designer who knows the basics of visual design and is looking to learn and migrate to design interfaces” or “a designer with 2-3 years of experience in delivering well-validated projects in usability testing”.
                
                For this, questions like the following may help to define the expectations of the company and to align with the team:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Why are we opening this position?                    </li>
                    <li>What does our area need?                    </li>
                    <li>How will the everyday activities of this designer be?                    </li>
                    <li>What are the objectives that we expect in the short, the medium and the long term?</li>
                </ul>
            <h5 class="sec-title"> What the team needs to learn            </h5>
            <p>Another way of looking is to ask yourself as your own team: what do we want to learn? After all, bringing some designer with specialty in points that the team needs to develop is an investment not only for the project, but for the whole company.

                In this case, I start by listing strengths and weaknesses.</br> For example: 
                
                Strengths: Prototyping, Interaction, Visual Design.
                Weaknesses: Research, Metrics and Data Analysis.
                
                “One simple way of finding what your team actually needs, it seems, is to look at where you are contracting out the most work. Start there. Next, look at where your gaps are as a leader.</br> For example, I am trained in UX design, but not as much in Interaction Design. For next hire, employers must fill that gap by looking for a designer with that Interaction background. </br> 
                
                Defining these points not only leaves all of the team and company on the same page but also helps at the time of the job description.</p>

            <h5 class="sec-title">Beyond the Interface</h5>
            <p>Yeah, I know how important the look and feel of the product. However, the story ends there for lots of designers, which leads to a problem of misunderstanding, ignoring the complexity of its implementation or skipping the reasoning that resulted in the interface. </br>

                To be clear, Dribble,Behance,AdobePortfolio and other online portfolio you created are great to look for references. We know how important those things are to instigate our design community, but business goals and product, brand, or service experience are not born of pixels, but from interacting with your users and other areas. </p>
