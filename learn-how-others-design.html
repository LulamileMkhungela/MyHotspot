Half did by email and the other half personally. The result was as follows:</p><div id="ead5" class="nz oa ob ao jx b ko oc od oe of og mx" data-selectable-paragraph=""><p class="jx b oh oi as">“We found that people were much more likely to agree to complete the task when they were asked in-person as opposed to over email. These findings are consistent with previous research showing that people are more likely to comply with requests in person than over email.” Vanessa Bohns</p></div><p id="1d07" class="mk ml eb ao mm b mn oj mp ok mr ol mt om mv on mx" data-selectable-paragraph="">You can say, therefore, that introducing yourself face-to-face to a recruiter is more efficient than sending an email or trying to connect on LinkedIn. Obviously, that doesn’t mean your chances of getting a job also increase by 34%, but the comparison works.</p><p id="8fa0" class="mk ml eb ao mm b mn my mp mz mr na mt nb mv nc mx" data-selectable-paragraph="">So in a heated market like the Design Industry, boosting your hiring chances can be a valuable tool, especially if you’re starting your career or changing from another field.</p><p id="ebf6" class="mk ml eb ao mm b mn my mp mz mr na mt nb mv nc mx" data-selectable-paragraph="">Also, most design events are hosted by HR people, so it’s also an opportunity to get to know the structure, the team and show interest in the available positions.</p></section>

Some have broader themes, others are more specific. There’s room to talk about anything from new functionality in Figma to how designers exchange feedback in a team.</p><p id="e426" class="mk ml eb ao mm b mn my mp mz mr na mt nb mv nc mx" data-selectable-paragraph="">That being said, it’s clear that the way you prepare for events may vary. There’s no need to ask all the questions in a single event or have all eyes on you. Rather, get the most out of each event thinking about what you need to evolve as a designer and the next steps of your career.</p></div>
