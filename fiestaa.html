                <p class="des">Recently at Tango, we’ve been working on quite an undertaking. We decided to give Tango a much-needed makeover, a redesign. We realized the company was at a place where a redesign could positively impact the product. You see, Tango is a social messaging application in a tech space that is extremely crowded. This means that its differentiating factors lie within its technology and UX. </br>In the last year, we have been working at solidifying the core technology that makes Tango useful. The part that was lacking was the UX and aesthetics. We found that pushing the app toward a social direction has left the core of the application unattended and that our most dedicated users were in fact our messaging users. Thus, we decided to split our application into two parts, a messaging app and a social app</p>

                <h2 class="head1">Creating Building Blocks                </h2>
                <p class="des">At the core, the redesign intended to create focus and unity for the company’s product. Additionally, it aimed to create simplicity and order amongst the chaos of features available to users. I knew the only way we could accomplish this effectively and quickly would be to adopt a systematic design process. I had previously read about Brad Frost's Atomic Design methodology and was fascinated by its scientific approach. Additionally, with the release of Material Design and Lightning Design System, a systematic approach felt appropriate for the scalability of the design for the future.  </br>

                    The goal was to create a design system that would evolve over time with the growth of the company. This was a task that had to be accomplished with the guidance and cooperation of engineering teams as it would allow for designers to think like developers and vice versa. </br>
                    
                    From looking at data, we concluded that the primary users of Tango hold Android devices. We also knew that if Tango wanted to continue growing globally we had to design for global markets, which naturally made us focus on Android platforms.  </br>

                <h2 class="head1">What's Next?</h2>
                <p class="des">Keep in mind, creating a design system is typically relevant when a company is at a place that can benefit from having a design system. At some companies like Google and Salesforce, they will often devote an entire time to the maintence. At Tango we're kicking off a simple and lean design system as the fundamentals for scaling our design as we grow. A good article to check out for reference is A Maturity Model for Design Systems By Marcelo Somers. </br>

                    We’ve been tackling this project for over four months now and have gather an abundance of data to help us continue iterating. The feedback we’ve received from users through user testing, surveys and of course launch has greatly impacted the changes we’ve continued making on the applications. We’re only grazed the tip of the iceberg with the visual refresh and with the creation of a system we’re now able to focus more on refining the UX of the products.</p>

                <h6 class="sec-title"><b>Conclusion</b></h6>
            <p class="des">Since rolling out the new feature, we've learned a lot about Tango users. We saw that a portion of our users are avid users of Discovery. I'm not authorized to disclose the exact metrics, but individuals would swipe up to thousands of cards for the reward of starting a few conversations with a few strangers. It's an interesting psychological game. Through interviewing some of them, we found that very rarely do they use the feature for dating. Their primary goal was for companionship. Many times it was triggered by the need to have a momentary casual conversation with someone who had zero biases about their current life.

                    The other finding we made was that a huge portion of our users primarily use the app for its communication features. The core of our app is still very much focused on allowing Tango users to communicate with their friends and family through messaging as well as audio and video calls. In allowing a feature like Discovery to dominate much of the application, a lot of our private users were receiving overwhelming amount of unwelcome chat requests from strangers who were focused on meeting new people. This obviously caused a lot of issues and eventually we decided that it was time to transition the application into more focused experiences for our 2 core groups of users, one more interested in social and the other messaging.
