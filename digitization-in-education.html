                <p class="desc">A platform that enables students to interactively and playfully create solutions to real-world challenges through Design Thinking and based on the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.

                    Through this concept of challenge-based learning, a closer integration of society and school as well as a stronger awareness of the student‘s responsibility and ability to act is achieved.
                    
                    It should be noted that this project was accompanied by a three-month user experience design training, followed by a fixed course plan and a digital implementation was planned. It helped me to deepen my knowledge in user experience design and to explore approaches to digitization of school lessons and to find out how impulses for modern learning can be set in accordance with the sustainability goals.</p>

                              <h3 class="insight-heading">Individual learning types<br></h3>
                              <p class="insight-paragraph">Through self-learning systems, the learning process can be individually adapted for each student. Studies have shown, for example, that students who were considered weak in the classroom, after a short time with adaptive, tailor-made curricula many were even better than the previous best in class. These students simply needed more time for the basics, which then led to better and faster understanding of the more complex follow-up topics.</p>

                              <h3 class="insight-heading">Timeliness &amp; availability<br></h3>
                              <p class="insight-paragraph">Outdated or incorrect information can be updated at any time. Textbooks would therefore be obsolete and materials could no longer be forgotten or lost at home. Insofar as there is sufficient Internet access, global availability is possible.</p>
                            </div>

                              <p class="insight-paragraph">Through the on-demand availability, self-organization regarding time, place and topic becomes possible. The pure transfer of knowledge (know-how) takes place digitally, which gives the teacher more time to offer individual advice and orientation (Know Why). The knowledge broker role of the teacher shifts into the background in favor of the role as the student‘s companion and guide.</p>

                              <p class="insight-paragraph">There is no cost to buy textbooks, which will also make it easier for financially weak families to access education. In addition, e-learning contributes to the saving of financial, human and time resources, i.a. by simplifying various processes for schools, teachers and students.</p>

                              <p class="insight-paragraph">Students receive immediate feedback and can work with teachers and parents to follow their learning process. There is a risk of over-control and thus less self-organized learning, but also the chance to measure one&#x27;s own learning progress less with other students and instead with one&#x27;s own progress.</p>

                            <p>Learning in the form of traditional teaching and e-learning both require self-discipline, motivation and acceptance of the methodology, whereby e-learning – in so far as it is used in isolation – relies more on intrinsic motivation.</p>

                            <p>With the knowledge of Design Thinking along with User Centered framework, E-Learning and the image of sustainable education.I then conducted interviews with pupils and teachers from the grades five to twelve.</p>

                                  <p class="insight-paragraph">Even lower-level students can handle apps of a high degree of complexity, while educators often take much longer. One consequence is that teachers are judged by the students not to be competent. In an attempt to regain authority, teachers tend to use unfavorable methods, thus the teacher-student relationship suffers. Is the positioning of teachers as knowledge facilitators still relevant?</p>

There are also regular room changes, unreliable technology and Internet connectivity, too few devices, hardly any maintenance of the technology, incompatibilities between programs and devices (e.g., smartboard not powerpoint enabled), and high setup times (e.g., slow build / install).</p>

                                  <p class="insight-paragraph">Great difference in the perception of students and teachers on how often digital devices are used for educational purposes. Students say the use of digital devices at their school is inadequate, while teachers feel they use them relatively frequently to make their lessons.</p>

                                <h3 class="sec-title" style="text-align: center;"><b>Learnings</b></h3>
                                <p><strong>#1 Big challenges require small steps</strong> <br>Take small steps, because big changes can not be brought overnight, especially not just by an application alone. Accordingly, develop more strategically meaningful and realistically applicable tools that steer in the intended direction.<br></p>
                                <p><strong>#2 Be open to research and let ideas go <br>‍</strong>I thought too digitally and approached the product with too concrete ideas about the result, thus failing to correctly take into account some needs and challenges of the target group and thus unfavorably defined the minimum viable product.<br></p>
                                <p><strong>#3 Journey Maps are my new best friend <br>‍</strong>Especially as it gets more complex, Journey mapping is very helpful, on the one hand to put a comprehensive process on paper and to uncover problematic and promising points, on the other hand to provide a basis for good cooperation for all stakeholders.<br></p>
                                <p><strong>#4 Distribute polls via Facebook pages <br>‍</strong>More participation than expected, surprisingly many insights won and many answers to open questions received. Facebook pages with the appropriate fellowship and activity can quickly reach a relevant target group.<strong>‍</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>#5 Interview questions chosen unfavorably <br>‍</strong>Looking back, I would rebuild the interviews differently as I used too many questions where interviewees should imagine what the optimal solution might be (for example, “describe your dream school”). Especially through the book “<a target="_blank" href="http://momtest.com">The Mom Test</a>” I have been able to uncover many of my mistakes. It would have needed further interviews with teachers and school management (as well as parents) to create a more complete picture.<br></p>
                                <p><strong>#6 More substantive visual design <br>‍</strong>In the meantime, inasmuch as no visual language has yet been defined, I would define brand attributes in advance, which can be used to orient oneself with regard to the visual appearance as well as (linguistic) formulations – see my project for youth culture work.<br></p>
                                <h3>There are already good analogue materials, which I would like to recommend at this point.</h3>
                                <p>For example, &quot;<a target="_blank" href="https://buildyourfuture.com/">Build your future</a>&quot; provides very good materials to do design thinking projects in schools. It should be emphasized here that not only students, but primarily the teachers are very well taken by the hand and thus the inhibition threshold is lower to carry out such projects.<br></p>
                                <p>For an entertaining insight into the topic of Design Thinking, e.g. suitable for single lessons, <a target="_blank" href="http://molly.is/writing/design-dash/">Molly&#x27;s Design Dash</a> is great, especially if you replace the predefined topics with real school challenges and the opportunity to work on the projects beyond school time.<br></p>
                                <p>Rather with high school students in mind, there would be the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.modelsofimpact.co/">Models of Impact</a> Game, where based on societal challenges, social entrepreneurial business models are developed.<br></p>
                                <p>‍</p>
