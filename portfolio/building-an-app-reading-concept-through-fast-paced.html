          <h3 class="insight-heading">Strategy<br></h3>
      <p>The first step of the design process involved user interviews and desk research to understand how competitors and users behave. I believe it’s important to get this information early on in the process, before having an idea or prototyping.</p>
            <p>By brainstorming and prioritizing brand attributes in various categories we created the basis to put together a mission statement – this took us just about 30 minutes.<br></p>
        <p><br> Once the interface was ready, I took feedback from two other fellow designers in order to understand the experience gaps. Validation, although part of my usual design process, would be a post-conceptualization and interface step and won’t be discussed in depth in this case.</br></p>

      <h3>User Interview</h3>
      <p> User interviews are a core user experience method. That’s why I chose to approach 10 people to interview, taking into account the recommendation from Donald Norman’s article, “Why You Only Need to Test with 5 Users,” noting that it is possible to learn about 80% of the errors, problems, and behavior from the first 6 users. <br>That would bring enough data and inputs to generate concepts and hypothesis. <br>After conceptualization phase, however, I’d take the prototype out to test with other users in order to gather more feedbacks and validation.</br></br></p>

          <p>The interview sample took into account men and women aged from 27 to 36, inserted in the economically active population at a certain area, and with different reading habits.</p>
            <p>The interview took approximately 30 minutes and included topics to get to the core of what users are trying to do and what their problems are. So I asked:</p>
              <p><b>1.</b> What are your reading habits <br><b>2.</b>Where do you get your content from</br><b>3.</b>What products do you use for reading.<br><b>4.</b> What kinds of incentives would make you read more. </p>

          <p>In addition, I researched data and habits related to other current Loyalty Programs.<br> The goal was to understand how competitors behave and benchmark innovative reward programs.<br>The article 10 Examples of Innovative Customer Loyalty Programs, published by Lindsey Peacock brings relevant examples to the discussion such as Sephora, Amazon Prime, Starbucks and Apple. Addressing different techniques for redeeming points and rewards.</br></p>

          <!--new--!>
       <div class="rich-kid w-richtext">
      <blockquote> Market Insights</blockquote>
      <p>The main insights found is that Loyalty programs have been proven as one of the most effective tactics for increasing revenue and inspiring customer loyalty. As many as 84% of consumers say they’re more apt to stick with a brand that offers a loyalty program. And 66% of customers say the ability to earn rewards actually changes their spending behavior.<br>
“As consumers, we can be pretty cynical about brands and marketing initiatives. We know the end goal is always to convince us to buy more products and spend more money. That’s why the most innovative loyalty program takes the focus away from getting customers to spend more, and re-centers itself on creating value for them.” </br> <br>By integrating users’ pain points and market insights, I understand that it’s possible to create a reward program that isn’t based solely on earning points by purchasing, but which adds value to a user’s daily life.

Thus, the value proposition hypothesis is based on helping users to create a healthy reading routine — since 70% of them claim to struggle with that — and reward them every time they return to work towards that goal through the bookify app. </br></p>

      <blockquote>CONCEPT PROCESS</blockquote>
      <h5>Conceptual Analysis</h5>
      <p>A rewards program that not only gives you points by shopping, but also rewards you for developing reading habits, encouraging you to become a genius in your area of interest</p>
      </div>

      <!--new--!>

          <div class="tagline insight-tagline">ABOUT #1</div>
          <h3 class="insight-heading">What Is Genius About <br></h3>
          <p>Genius is bookify’s reward program. Its value proposition is to offer daily and weekly triggers to get the user to develop a reading habit and return daily to the App.</p>
          <h4>So, how do I earn points?</h5>
            <p>Users are rewarded with 1 point for completing a daily reading task of 10 minutes, limited to a maximum of 1 point per day. In addition, when users complete 7 consecutive days of readings, they are also awarded with <b>15 points.</b> <br>

A standard bonus system was also added to this model, in which points are earned for each purchase since the learning curve is smaller and this system could be a gateway for those users who bought a book and still don’t have a strong reading habit. Therefore, every <b>R 12</b> used in book purchases returns as <b>12 point</b> for the user to redeem. </br></p>
          <h4>So, how do I redeem points?</h5>
            <p>I took into account that the first points should be easier to reach and, with a daily reading habit of just 10 minutes, a user can earn enough points to get at least 5% discounts for the first month.</p>

      <blockquote>FLOW PROCESS</blockquote>
      <h5>User Flow</h5>
      <p>The main point of the flow is to ensure that the functionality is always visible to the user, but not in an obstructive way. So I decided to add it to the app’s bottom navigation. It’s only a tap away, but still not intrusive.<br>

By tapping on the genius icon, users are taken to the onboard flow, interest collection and dashboard where they can check point balance and rewards.<br></p>

      <h3>User Interface <br>On-Boarding </br></h3>
      <p>Since this Reward program differs from competitors available in the market, it’s important that users understand the value proposition quickly: not just a point accumulator by purchasing, but a tool that accumulates points according to a user’s commitment to reading.</p>
      <p>That’s why it’s important to create a space in the flow to explain the benefits of the Genius Reward Program. I chose to do this through an automatic slider. Almost effortless for users see all content. The primary “get started” button is always visible on the screen, so the onboard assigns an overview of the functionality, but it doesn’t prevent them from continuing through the flow.

Also, the onboard would appear only the first time a user went through the flow. From the moment the user opts-in, this functionality turns into a “how it works” item on the dashboard.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="rich-kid w-richtext">
      <h3>User Interests </h3>
      <p>Collecting topics that are most interesting to the user can help improve the referral system in a way that exchange of points is done by books relevant to the user’s daily life.<br>

The choice of health, music, travel, arts, technology, food and design as topics has been based on desk research. So, they’re similar to what’s used by other booksellers in the market. </br></p>

     <div class="rich-kid w-richtext">
      <h3>DashBoard </h3>
<p>This screen is responsible for giving users a place to track their points. It has been thought to resemble a dashboard and bring the sense of status tracking.


The dashboard is split into “point status”, “rewards” and “How it works”, the latter being a space for the user to learn about how the program works.

On the time chart for daily reading, users can also see the 10 minute daily goal they wanna reach. This way they can plan and understand if they are closer or farther from their goal.</p>

      <p>The brand’s guidelines led us to pick a playful and inviting tone, so we chose purple and green to break the white and make the brand youthful and remarkable.

Yellow was added as well to give the interface a warmer look and contrast with illustrations.

For text, a much darker variation of purple has been brought in to ensure reading and contrast, thus reaching appropriate levels of accessibility.</p>

<div class="rich-kid w-richtext">
      <h3>Typography </h3>
      <p>Since 50% of users said they prefer reading paper books for feeling and nostalgia, we understand that this could be used as an opportunity in the app interface. Therefore, we use the combination of Tiempos serif typography with a sans-serif Circular.</p>

      <h3>Validation </h3>
      <p>The Genius Reward Program should not become just a one-time delivery. It should be iterated by considering usability tests, A/B tests, and other in-depth surveys with the user to improve the initial version.

That said, launching this functionality is only the first step towards the program’s success.

In this way, analyzing metrics such as reading time, daily reading frequency, total points earned over time, and interests collected on the onboard would be important for understanding success and elaborating the product roadmap.</p>

      <h3>More On Project Setting Goals</h3>
      <p>By brainstorming and prioritizing ideas in terms of efficiency <em>(“How can we make our internal processes or the processes within our products or services more efficient?”)</em> and awareness <em>(“What can we do to be seen?”)</em>, we quickly came to a roadmap with the next steps, focusing not just on the website, but also on the organization itself – I believe that a strong organization is more likely to create strong products and services. </p>

        <p><strong>Learning<br>‍</strong>In retrospect, I feel this exercise wasn‘t exactly what the client expected (probably an issue with my positioning) because I aimed towards thinking about the whole ecosystem instead of just the website itself (and probably failed on communicating it sufficiently in the beginning). </p>
        <p>Usually, I do this exercise also in terms of revenue, but since the organization is well-funded, we‘ve left it out to save time. To expose potentially hidden treasures, I think it would have been good to do it anyway.<br></p>
        <p>Also, I realized that the rating by numbers is kinda abstract. For the future I‘d prefer the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHI-vCSX0Uo">effort impact mapping</a> exercise, since it is way more tangible by evaluating the ideas by needed effort and expected impact, categorizing them into “Do now” (low effort, high impact), “Make it a project” (high effort, high impact), “Make it a task” (low effort, low impact) and “Skip” (high effort, low impact).</p>

      <h4>WORKSHOP #2 </h4>
      <h2>Information Architecture</h2>
      <h3>Content Audit</h3>
      <p>To understand the old site and its content, I ran a content audit listing all available information and features. Based on this, we collectively decided what to keep, what to kick and how content can be integrated into a more intuitive information architecture.</p>
      <h3>Sitemap</h3>
      <p>Joint development of the sitemap, taking into account the defined proto-personas and the respective solutions to their problems and motivations as well as the objectives.</p>

        <p><strong>Learning<br>‍</strong>To make sure that the redesign isn‘t based too much on old content respectively to gain a fresh point of view, I will add one or two extra steps in the future.</p>
        <ol start="1" role="list">
          <li>Rather than diving straight into the results of content auditing and building the new site based on the old content, it makes sense to challenge the group to list all of the content areas that they remember – without, of course, visiting the site. If anything is missing, this is a good sign to question whether these contents really need to stay in the new design.</li>
          <li>Create more stakeholders (proto-personas, 3-6) and think about what they need from the site before diving into the old content – and finally add what&#x27;s important to the organization, too.<br>‍</li>
        </ol>

    <div class="rich-kid w-richtext">
      <h3>Evaluation via Tree Tests</h3>
      <p>To ensure an intuitive understanding of the site‘s structure I tested the sitemap on-site with potential users through so-called tree-testing by giving them relevant tasks, such as &quot;Where would you click if you wanted to join a theatre group?&quot; Based on the test results, the sitemap has been adjusted accordingly.</p>
      <h3>Building the Site Structure</h3>
      <p>Jointly creating low-fidelity wireframes. The advantage was a direct buy-in of the approximate structure.</p>

        <p><strong>Learning<br>‍</strong>In retrospect, that was too much for the same workshop day, as the focus faded due to too many previous discussions. Nevertheless, the few we had completed were helpful as a starting point for the design phase, and after that, only very small concept changes were necessary. <br></p>
        <p>In the future I will try a different approach – inspired by the UX workshop format from <a target="_blank" href="http://verynice.co/">verynice</a> – in which each person creates sketches of each main page, followed by a comparison of the various approaches and finally the creation of a best-of version. I prefer it because this way you go from quantity to quality.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Due to the flawless collaboration, after the workshops hardly any revisions were required, neither in information architecture nor in visual design. As a bonus, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kimard.com/">Anaurd Kimard</a> was by my side, observing me how I do workshop facilitation and giving me honest and valuable feedback – that was awesome.<br></p>
      <p>As a learning: Make sure to really (I mean, really really) get the expectations of the group right and to clearly communicate the exact goal of the individual exercises – I thought I did so, but I felt a lack of understanding here and there.<br></p>
      <p>Since I don‘t know all the technical details of building a Wordpress site, some concepts were way more complex to implement, respectively way more complex to maintain by the client. Generally – and as I‘m able to do so – I would prefer to keep up the fast pace of the process by developing the website myself and being able to adjust little details without too much effort.<br></p>
      <p>However, if there was more time, I would divide each of the workshops into two shorter days to keep up the focus. In addition, instead of two, I would build at least three personas, also run the prioritization exercise for revenue, and test the sitemap and site structure more thoroughly.</p>
