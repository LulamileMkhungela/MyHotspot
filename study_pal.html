                    <h3 class="head3"><b>Project Overview</b></h3>
                    <p class="desc">Since the COVID-19 pandemic has isolated us all in our homes for a long period of time and the most affected group is little school going kids as this pandemic has put their future at stake. I thought of an app that fills up the gap between students and teachers as I couldn’t find any app that provides schooling experience digitally.
                        This app is to help students stay organized with their different subject lessons/classes. Enable students to learn virtually at home and keep them connected to their classmates and teachers. Reminder for homework submission and calender to prepare individual students beforehand for upcoming quiz.</p>
                     </div>

                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <h3 class="head3"><b>Problem</b></h3>
                    <p class="des3">I saw my nephew struggling hard while attending class online via zoom call due to ongoing pandemic and teacher on other hand had to ask student multiple times to catch their attention. I understand people are managing it with zoom calls or skype etc, but they don’t provide students as well as teacher the proper class room experience.
                        Though it does provide one-on-one interactions, But it has been noticed in alot of cases that students are caught doing idiotic things like howling, calling out names that annoys the teachers and disturbs other students who want to study. Additionally there is no proper recordings of videos just in case, if any student missed any call or couldn’t understand in one go due to internet issues. Having recordings can help teachers to plan their future lectures. There is no utility in zoom calls or skype calls where teachers can send assignments to students and students can submit them.
                        Another thing that is hard for parents is keeping a constant check of their child's progress of assignments and quiz submissions. For little kids parents has to be around to monitor all the time unlike for middle school kids.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <h3 class="head3"><b>Solution</b></h3>
                    <p class="des3">Overall theme including fonts, buttons, icons to be kept fun and colorful to keep students engaged.
                        Live classes to join orelse have access to recorded video or written notes, if class is missed.
                        Students to have saperate chat room to communicate with friends/classmates and teacher regarding lessons or extra curriculum activities. So if any student comes up with random questions during live class, teacher can direct them to ask privately in chatroom, it will minimize the unnecessary disturbance.
                        Each student to have access to view due dates of quiz/assignment/homework in timely manner, no chance of forgetting or missing because notifications would be sent on the phone aswell. Calender in the app also has upcoming events highlighted
                        Progress report with graph and average marks after every quiz result is updated for students, to push themselves for better grades and also provide convenience for parents, to stay updated about their child performance.
                        Reimagined all needed features that could be designed all in one app. I started research, sketch out my ideas to design an app particularly for school going kids to provide them classroom experience digitally.</p>

                        <p class="des" style="padding-top: 10px;">Before I began my design project, I conducted survey interviews with 16 parents of school-age kids to get a better understanding of whom I was designing this app for:


                            Since this app is planned to be elementary and middle school kids. So among the 16 parents I interviewed, there were mostly young females parents. The age of the parents ranged from 24 to 38 years old, while couple of female parents over the age of 40 years old. Out of which 43.8% had elementary school-age children and 12.5% had middle school-age children.
                        </p>

                    <p class="des3" style="padding-top: 10px;">I felt like taking opinion on whether parents still prefer remote learning for their kids or not. And currently what digital solution they are using for it. Over 50% parents still are in favor of online schooling and 25% combintion of both remote and in school. Mostly are using zoom or google meet.

                    <p class="des3" style="padding-top: 10px;">To my surprise, honesty of these ladies while taking this survey needs some applause. When asked about current online learning situation, none of them find it bad but on the other hand not so great too, just on the satisfactory level. Additionally, 90% of the ladies find their kids struggle to keep constant interest and focus.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="col-md-7">

                    <p class="des3" style="padding-top: 10px;">To make this even more interesting, I asked about different challenges they face as a family due to current learning setup. Timing of parents and children to match for monitoring and learning can clearly be hard. Additionally, mostly parents do admit that they are unable to stay updated about their child performace/progress level. 33% children are unable to balance quiz and homework submission.</br> Now that you have a better understanding of why and who I was designing this app for, it has become easy to gather basic needs and functionality goals for this application. </p>

        <p style="text-align: center;">To make sure this app is designed truely to student needs so I stayed focused on the insights I was able to fetch from the research throughout the design process. </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">For this project I conducted usability testings - the Guerrilla testing between the wireframing sketch and high-fidelity and after prototyping, to check if my iteration worked. </br>
             The testings were extremely effective for identifying the minor issues in my prototype and to improve the student's experience while using the app. </br>
              Moreover, to let these issues to be fixed with much less time and lower cost, It's necessary that usability testing is conducted during design process. </br>I ran the usability testing by sharing the prototype with 5 young parents with their school-age kids. I asked them to complete major tasks, register/login, creating profile, analysing features of calender and progress report... etc. I observed them remotely online through screen that was shared with me.</p>

                <p class="des">Building an virtual school product for children is not as easy, though it’s kind of fun that can sometimes even be challenging aswell. Specially to make sure that kids has to stay attentive throughout at the sametime make it fun, intuitive and interactive. Also taken into consideraion that this app is making life easier for teachers and parents aswell.</p>
                <h6 class="sec-title"><b>What I can do better</b></h6>
                <p class="des">
                    This version of app is more specific for kids and how they are going to interact with the features. For the nexttime, I plan to make a version concentrating on teachers. How a teacher can make their profile, select their school and subjects. How teacher would be enable to take attendence, come live for lectures, record lectures, add notes for students and check quiz and update student report. I think that would give this product an added value.</p>
